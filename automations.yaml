#   The contents of this file are generated by the
#   Automation Editor.  Any comments (like these)
#   will be deleted by the Automation Editor when content
#   is generated -  i.e. if you use the Automation Editor,
#   and look for these notes afterwards, they will have
#   been replaced with generated contents.
#
#   Any manually written code will be preserved, but
#   preferred order will not be preserved though the
#   code will remain executable without error.
#
#   If you have comments or manually created code you wish
#   to preserve intact, put them in automations/automations.yaml
#   and add the following line to configuration.yaml
#
#   automation old: !include_dir_merge_list automations
#
#   See https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/automation/editor/
#   for details of how this works.
